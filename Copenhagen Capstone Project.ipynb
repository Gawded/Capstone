    "Copenhagen is the capital as well as the most populous city of Denmark. As of januar 1st 2020 the city had a population of 794,128 spanning 179,8 km<sup>2</sup>, giving a population density of 4,417/km<sup>2</sup>. Copenhagen is a sprawling metropolis with a large number of venues for entertainment / enjoyment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copenhagen can be divided into a number of boroughs. From an investment point of view, if you would like to open a shop / venue, you are of course interested in the price of real estate, as well as the saturation of venues in the area. An investor might look for a cheap location that is not overly saturated by similar venues. From a residential point of view you are again looking for a cheap location, but a large number of venues is now a positive. From this it can be said that the target audience includes both potential real estate investors, as well as private people looking for a residential property. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, it becomes interesting to examine where you get the most bang for your buck - i.e. where an investor can get the cheapest real estate in an area not already saturated by other venues, and where a potential resident can minimize the cost of real estate while maximizing the number of nearby venues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the above problems, it is possible to create a map with information on venue density and real estate price. From this it will be possible to extrapolate where you get the lowest real estate prices combined with the lowest / highest density of venues."
